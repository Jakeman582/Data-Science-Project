# Data Science Project (DS501)

## Preliminary title: "The times, They Are 'a Changin': American Music Trends of the Past Century"

This repo holds all of the code I'm developing for my class project. I'm going to document the whole process including 
 * Data collection
 * Data Scraping
 * Data Cleaning
 * Data Exploration
 * Machine Learning

 The goal of my project is to better understand what elements of music the American public have enjoyed since 1900, and to see how those interests have evolved over time.

 I'm interested in exploring what musical elements have been popular, and what sorts of lyrical themes have been popular over the past century, and up to the present year.

 According to the Spotify API, any values associated with the song's audio features should not be stored. As 
 such, I will not upload any actual data regarding audio features. Instead, for the purposes of being able 
 having data to use, random data will be generated.
